# 💘 Ultimate Valentine's Day Page — Fun & Quirky Edition

## Overview
Convert the existing Valentine's HTML page into a React app and crank up the fun factor with over-the-top interactions, humor, and quirky effects.

## Page 1: The Question Screen
- **Bouncing bear emoji** with a bold, pulsing "Will You Be My Valentine?" heading
- **Pink gradient background** with floating hearts raining down
- **"Yes!" button** — big, inviting, glowing with a heartbeat effect
- **"No" button** — the classic runaway button that dodges the cursor every time you try to click it
  - Each dodge attempt shows increasingly dramatic/funny messages: "Are you sure?", "Think again!", "I'll cry! 💔", "Don't do this to me 😭", etc.
  - The button gets smaller and faster with each attempt, making it nearly impossible to click
  - After many attempts, the "Yes" button grows even bigger to fill more of the screen

## Page 2: The Celebration Screen (on clicking Yes)
- **Explosion of confetti** with colorful pieces raining down
- **Giant heartbeat animation** with a "Yaaay! I knew it! 🥰" message
- **Sparkle/firework emoji bursts** appearing randomly around the screen
- **"Happy Valentine's Day!"** text with a fun bounce-in animation
- **Fun quirky touches**: random love-themed memes/emojis floating around, a virtual bear doing a happy dance (CSS animation)

## Interactive Extras
- **Cursor trail**: Small hearts follow the mouse cursor around the page
- **Click anywhere**: Clicking anywhere on the background spawns a burst of tiny hearts
- **Sound-free but dramatic**: Screen shake effect when the "No" button runs away
- **Mobile friendly**: The runaway button works on touch devices too

## Design Style
- Bold, vibrant pinks and reds with playful gradients
- Oversized emojis and fun serif/handwritten-style typography
- Bouncy, exaggerated animations throughout
- Quirky humor baked into every interaction
